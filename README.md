# EnDe
A highly ergonomic English/ German keyboard layout for standard ISO keyboards or 3x6 columnar staggered keyboards. It has really good analyzer stats, but gives an even better typing feel :-) Unlike many modern layouts optimized primarily for English, EnDe maintains consistent ergonomic performance across both English and German. And with simple character swaps enabling excellent typing feel in Dutch, French and Spanish.

This layout is an alternative to [anymak:END](https://github.com/rpnfan/Anymak). It is based on the same proven principles. The difference to anymak:END are as follows:

The default shift key position from a standard keyboard is used and not changed.This allows to use more keys and has two benefits and two disadvantages

**Advantages over anymak:END**

* Due that change some analyzer statistics numbers, such as same-finger-bigrams have been improved.
* The layout includes all German diacritics on the base layer, instead of requiring to access them on a separate layer.

**Disadvantages over anymak:END**

* The shift key is left in the default position, which is not easy to reach, but requires an unergonomic stretch of the pinky — or moving the floating hand. In contrast anymak:END does not use the ISO-shift key position at all and avoids this uncomfortable position. You can however use one-shot shift with EnDe as well. Note that EnDe requires an ISO-keyboard and cannot be adapted in a meaningful way to an ANSI keyboard. But if you mainly use ANSI-keyboards you likely will have English as your main language and anymak:END is the suggested layout in that case.
* anymak:END has a one-shot layer key available on the left and right hand. For EnDe the right layer key is used for the character 'ß', so it does not allow to place the one-shot layer key there any longer. Swiss people could recover that position although :-).

If you prefer anymak:END or EnDe is a matter of preference. Both layouts will feel great, with somewhat different strong sides and weaker sides. But mostly the layouts are very similar (see details below).

## Layout Overview
The layout can be used directly on an ISO-keyboard. The finger position is symmetrical for the left and right hand. The right hand is as usual and the left hand like follows: 'qhk' is the pinky-row, '.aä' the row of the ring finger and so on. See also the finger columns on a columnar staggered keyboard below. For both keyboard types the handpositions stay exactly the same and are symmetrical for the left and right hand.

This is how the layout looks on a a columnar staggered split keyboard:

## Statistics

The screenshots with keyboard statistics below are taken from the analyzer from Cyanophage and give a first impression how the layout fares. The EnDe layout scores very well in regards to statistics. But note that the analyzers do not fully describe the typing experience. For example the suggested layout could slightly be tweaked to get a tiny bit better SFBs (same-finger-bigrams) by swapping m-w, but I deliberately have chosen the current position, because I find it slightly easier to type that way. You can swap those two characters if you prefer. Try typing 'will', 'much', 'poland' and 'wc' with both variants and choose according to your preference or if you prefer 'm' or 'w' on the stronger middle finger.

**Comparison to Graphite — a modern layout alternative**

To give you an idea why it can be interesting to consider EnDe, let's compare it again Graphite and Gallium. These two are modern layouts which are increasingly used — for good reasons, because they are very balanced layouts resulting in a typing experience many people enjoy. The EnDe layout also tries to achieve a great balance between all the parameters a keyboard layout is optimized for. In comparison to Graphite it puts less focus on same-finger-bigrams, but still trying to keep those pretty low. The remaing same-finger-bigrams on EnDe are mostly on the strong index and middle finger — from the top-row back to the home-row. That makes the same-finger-bigrams still relative comfortable to type. On keyboards with u-shaped keycaps such as [MCC](https://kbd.news/MCC-keycap-profile-962.html) for Choc switches, you can even "rake" the finger from one row to the other. 

Another difference is that high frequency keys are put on the stronger index and middle finger as far as possible. That is one reason that the common letter 'e' is on the middle finger instead the weaker ring finger it is on Graphite/ Gallium. Both Graphite/ Gallium and EnDe largely avoid awkward finger motions, such as scissors, re-directs, SFBs and large stretches. The performance in regards to those bad keyboard layout characteristics are roughly in the same range for the three layouts.

One of the most important characterists for a layout to not cause discomfort are a high amount of hand alternations — not forcing you to type long sequences just with one hand. Again, the three layouts are very close in that regard. 

But EnDe has two advantages over many other layouts. For a high-alternation layout it has still a relatively high amount of inward-rolls. This is something you can likely feel and enjoy during your typing. For English Graphite has 21.7 % inward rolls. That is comparable to many other modern layouts not using a thumb-character key. EnDe in contrast has 27.7 % inward-rolls. That is on the high side for that class of layouts for a standard keyboard.

The second unique and rare characteristic for a keyboard layout is that EnDe is not only optimized for English, but has about the same performance — means comfortable typing feel — for several European languages.

### Graphite - German
Diacritics are added here for comparison to evaluate German. The original Graphite does not offer diacritics, but the statistics are not changed that much by the umlauts -- regardless if the umlaut placement has been optimized (not the case here). Still for real-world typing the umlauts are relevant to place wisely, because regardless of the low frequency you will get quickly annoyed when they are in hard to reach places and do not fit into the typing flow.

### anymak:END - German
Note that Cyanophage's analyzer does not allow to exactly display how anymak:END is setup (with one-shot shift and layers keys and the diacritics on the extra layer). The below screenshot is therefore just an approximation, where the umlauts are placed on the base-layer. Because of the low frequency of the umlauts the statistic values will not differ too much from the real layout, but they would be a little bit better if the analyzer would take into account the real umlaut key positions.
